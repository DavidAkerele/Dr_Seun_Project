            <h3>Basics of Computing</h3>
            <p>
              Computers are electronic devices that accept data as input in prescribed form,
              stores data, and reproduces such data as information in processed form. Computers can be intimidating, especially if you didn't grow up with them.
              Some tasks that seem simple to experienced users can seem impossible to new users.
              This course sheds more light as to what computers are and gives you complete information on how to use a computer.

                    <p>The word 'Computer' derives itself from the Latin word "computare" meaning 'to calculate'.</p>
                    <p>A computer is simply an electronic machine that accepts data as input, processes such data, and provides such data as output in processed form called Information.</p>
                    <p>According to popular beliefs, the first computer was the Analytical Engine. Charles Babbage is considered unanimously as the father of computer because it was him who developed the first computer (Analytical Engine) in 1837.</p>
                    <h3>Classifications of a Computer</h3>
                    <p>There are two classifications of computer. They are</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Data Handling Capability</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h5>Classification Based on Data Handling Capability</h5>
                    <p>There are three types of computer based on data handling capability. They are</p>

                        <b>Analogue Computer</b>
                        <p>
                          Analogue computers are designed to process analogue data. Analogue data is continuous data that changes continuously and cannot have discrete values. We can say that analogue computers are used where we don't need exact values always such as speed, temperature, pressure and current.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Analogue computers directly accept the data from the measuring device without first converting it into numbers and codes. They measure the continuous changes in physical quantity and generally render output as a reading on a dial or scale. Speedometer and mercury thermometer are examples of analogue computers.

                        <b>Digital Computer</b>
                        <p>
                          Digital computer is designed to perform calculations and logical operations at high speed. It accepts the raw data as input in the form of digits or binary numbers (0 and 1) and processes it with programs stored in its memory to produce the output. All modern computers like laptops, desktops including smartphones that we use at home or office are digital computers.

                        <b>Hybrid Computer</b>
                        <p>
                          Hybrid computer has features of both analogue and digital computer. It is fast like an analogue computer and has memory and accuracy like digital computers. It can process both continuous and discrete data. It accepts analogue signals and convert them into digital form before processing. So, it is widely used in specialized applications where both analogue and digital data is processed. For example, a processor is used in petrol pumps that converts the measurements of fuel flow into quantity and price. Similarly, they are used in airplanes, hospitals, and scientific applications.

                        <p>
                          Supercomputers are the biggest and fastest computers. They are designed to process huge amount of data. A supercomputer can process trillions of instructions in a second. It has thousands of interconnected processors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Supercomputers are particularly used in scientific and engineering applications such as weather forecasting, scientific simulations and nuclear energy research. The first supercomputer was developed by Roger Cray in 1976.

                          It is a midsize multiprocessing computer. It consists of two or more processors and can support 4 to 200 users at one time. Miniframe computers are used in institutes and departments for tasks such as billing, accounting and inventory management. A minicomputer lies between the mainframe and microcomputer as it is smaller than mainframe but larger than a microcomputer.

                          Mainframe computers are designed to support hundreds or thousands of users simultaneously. They can support multiple programs at the same time. It means they can execute different processes simultaneously. These features of mainframe computers make them ideal for big organizations like banking and telecom sectors, which need to manage and process high volume of data.

                    <b>Central Processing Unit</b>
                    <p>A Central Processing Unit is also called a processor, central processor, or microprocessor. It carries out all the important functions of a computer. It receives instructions from both the hardware and active software and produces output accordingly. It stores all important programs like operating systems and application software. CPU also helps Input and output devices to communicate with each other. Owing to these features of CPU, it is often referred to as the brain of the computer.</p>
                    <p>Generally, a CPU is made up of three parts, namely:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU</b>) which performs arithmetic and logical functions. Arithmetic functions include addition, subtraction, multiplication division, and comparisons. Logical functions mainly include selecting, comparing, and merging the data. A CPU may contain more than one ALU. Furthermore, ALUs can be used for maintaining timers that help run the computer.</li><br>
                      <li><b>Control Unit (CU)</b> which makes use of electrical signals to instruct the computer system for executing already stored instructions. It takes instructions from memory and then decodes and executes these instructions.</li><br>

                      <li>
                        <b>Primary Memory</b>
                        <p>Primary memory is of two types:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li type="circle"><b>Random Access Memory (RAM)</b> which is a volatile memory. It means it does not store data or instructions permanently. When you switch on the computer the data and instructions from the hard disk are stored in RAM. <br> CPU utilizes this data to perform the required tasks. As soon as you shut down the computer the RAM loses all the data.</li><br>
                          <li type="circle"><b>Read Only Memory (ROM)</b> which is a non-volatile memory. It means it does not lose its data or programs that are written on it at the time of manufacture. So it is a permanent memory that contains all important data and instructions needed to perform important tasks like the boot process.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li><br>

                        <b>Secondary Memory</b>
                        <p>The secondary storage devices which are built into the computer or connected to the computer are known as a secondary memory of the computer. It is also known as external memory or auxiliary storage.</p>
                        <p>The secondary memory is accessed indirectly via input/output operations. It is non-volatile, so permanently stores the data even when the computer is turned off or until this data is overwritten or deleted. The CPU can't directly access the secondary memory. First, the secondary memory data is transferred to primary memory then the CPU can access it.</p>
